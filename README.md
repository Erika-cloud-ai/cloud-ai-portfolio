# Cloud & AI Learning Portfolio

This repository contains my daily learning records, hands-on labs,
and structured notes related to cloud platforms, automation, and AI.

## Purpose
- Build practical cloud and automation skills across multiple platforms
- Understand infrastructure, automation, and AI from a system-level perspective
- Create a clear and maintainable portfolio for future job interviews

## Learning Philosophy
I focus not only on *how* to use tools and services, but also *why* they are
designed the way they are.
My goal is to build reusable, well-documented knowledge that reflects
real-world operational thinking and cross-platform understanding.

## Why Cloud Platforms & AI
Modern systems are built on cloud infrastructure, automation, and
increasingly, AI-driven components.

- **AWS** is a global standard widely used in enterprise environments.
- **Microsoft Azure** is deeply integrated with enterprise ecosystems
  and hybrid cloud solutions.
- **Google Cloud & Python Automation** emphasize automation, scripting,
  and operational efficiency.
- **AI technologies** act as an intelligence layer on top of cloud systems.

By studying these together, I aim to understand not just individual tools,
but how modern systems are designed, operated, and automated end-to-end.
